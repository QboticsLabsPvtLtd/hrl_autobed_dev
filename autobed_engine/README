Hi! You're probably here because:
a. You want to run the Autobed.
b. Or you want to send commands to the Bed and make it follow your commands.
c. Both of the above.

To run the autobed:
1. Clone hrl_autobed_dev
2. Run the following:
    >> rosrun hrl_autobed_dev autobed_engine.py /dev/ttyUSB0 (path to hrl_autobed_dev)/params/darpa_arm_prox_sensors_link_1.yaml 9600 4

    Arguments explained:
    /dev/ttyUSB0 : device name of the port of the base station to which the XBee is connected.
    (path to hrl_autobed_dev)/params/darpa_arm_prox_sensors_link_1.yaml : Parameter file that specifies position and calibration information of the SHARP IR sensors.
    9600 : baudrate
    4 : number of sensors on the bed. Yes, I know there are only 3 at the moment. Use number 4 anyway.  


To play with the Autobed: 
1. Ensure the autobed engine(described above) is running.
2. Ensure that the Autobed sensor module is plugged in. That's the little box serially connected to the Autobed Motors.
3. The Autobed Subscribes to topic '/abdin0'. 
   Format : Array of Floats of length 3 with entries [ head_angle, bed_ht, leg_angle]
   For example : [30.0, 20.0, 0.0] causes the bed to move its head to 30 degrees, height to 20 cm, legs stay down.
4. Thresholds for the inputs that can be given to the Autobed:
            upper threshold = np.array([65.0, 40.0, 20.0])
            lower threshold = np.array([1.0, 9.0, 0.0])
5. The Autobed also outputs its status. Subscribe to '/abdstatus0' and '/abdout0'. Status will output a bool True when done. Abd Output will start spitting the error between the commanded position and actual position.
6. IMPORTANT: Write your code so that once you see true on '/abdstatus0', stop publishing on '/abdin0'.
