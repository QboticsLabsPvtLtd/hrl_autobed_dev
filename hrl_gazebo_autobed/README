**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING GAZEBO AND RVIZ DEMOS OF AUTOBED:
GAZEBO LAUNCH INSTRUCTIONS:
[Under Construction]
RVIZ LAUNCH NOTES:
1. This demo can only be constructed with the closed-loop Autobed.
2. The closed loop autobed can be equipped with two types of sensors:
    2.1 In the lab, we shall use the motion capture data to get autobed angles. For this purpose, we have equipped the auto-bed with markers on its side.
    2.2 In the field (Henry Evans' home, etc.) we will use the accelerometer
and sharp sensors to measure angles.
    
3. This demo will work only in the lab in its current form.

RVIZ LAUNCH INSTRUCTIONS:
Step 1: Boot up the Autobed running the ROS RPi.
Step 2: On the machine that runs the motion capture software, set up three
markers: abd_head_angle, abd_leg_angle, camera_o. Attach abd_head_angle and
abd_leg_angle to the head and lower end of the bed respectively. Zero out the
marker angles by making sure the bed is supine and then reset all orientations.
Similarly, set up the camera_o marker on the kinect in the lab.

Step 3: Make sure the Kinect and the FSA pressure mat are connected to the Mac
Mini (OR any computer that is communicating with the Windows machine runnning
the MOCAP software)

Step 4: Turn on the machine that communicates with the motion capture software
and run the following instructions:
roscd autobed_physical_trainer
source boot_autobed_sensors.sh

Step 5: On your computer or any computer that has the ROS Master pointed to the Autobed RPi master, run the following:
roscd hrl_gazebo_autobed
source rviz_start_autobed.sh

Step 6: You should see the RViz interface set up with a PCL of the test
chamber, URDF of the bed, and a simulation of the pressure mat.
